# CS 165: Project 2
This project involves testing various sorting algorithms and determining their 
real-world running times experimentally.

# Motivation
This is based on the instructions for the second project of CS 165 
[here](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~goodrich/teach/cs165/proj/proj2.html). How I am
approaching the project is test-driven, with the tests being made first before
the sorts are applied onto the inputs.
