\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
    The purpose of this project is to examine and measure the performance of
    different bin packing algorithms by experimentally determining the quality 
    of solutions that the algorithms produce. This quality is determined by
    the waste $W(A)$ of a bin-packing algorithm $A$, which is defined as the 
    following:
    \begin{center}
        \textit{The number of bins used by algorithm $A$ minus the total sum of 
        all items in the given list.}
    \end{center}
    These will go over different algorithms to solve the bin-packing problem,
    using the observed waste for each algorithm to determine which is the most
    effective algorithm for this problem.
\subsection{Experimental Setup}
\subsection{Outline}
    The paper will delve into the following algorithms:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Next Fit (NF)
        \item First Fit (FF) and First Fit Decreasing (FFD)
        \item Best Fit (BF) and Best Fit Decreasing (BFD)
    \end{enumerate}
    \noindent The implementation and measure of performance of each algorithm 
    will be done, with FF and BF having counterparts with modifications on the 
    input to be compared to. Finally, the analysis will be done, with a verdict
    on which algorithm is the best for the bin-packing problem at the end.
